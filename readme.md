# Webpack- Minimal Boilerplate Setup Starter

This is my personal `webpack` configuration, that I am using for small static projects or as starter for libraries development.

Feel free to contribute, improve or use it for your projects.


### Contains some neat stuff out of the box!

- Webpack
- Babel


### What does this configuration handles?


> Common for development & production environment

- it accepts one entry point; `src/index.js`
- it compiles everything with relative paths, rather than absolute


> Development environment

- it runs webpack-dev-server
- it builds source-maps


> Production environment

- it minifies `js`
- it has subresource-integrity


### Requirements

- Nodejs 8 as a minimum

### Commands?

It's pretty easy... You do not have a bunch of commands, just two of them:

- `npm install` – to install libraries
- `npm run dev` – to start with development
- `npm run build` - to make it ready for production use
